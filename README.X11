Although vlock is primarily designed to lock the text console of a machine it
is also possible to use it from X.  Using the "--new" option vlock will switch
to an empty virtual terminal and then lock the display by preventing console
switching entirely.  After successful authentication it switches back to the
virtual terminal that was active when vlock was started, i.e. your X session,
when started from X.
